# MeMe
Built an app that takes pictures and overlays text to make memes out of friends, family, or pets. Also allows sharing with others via social media or email, and viewing past memes in a table or collection view.

## How to use
This app can be run on a device running iOS 10.0 or higher. Take a photo or choose a photo from the photo libary. You can then append text either on the top of the photo or on the bottom. Photos may be saved to the user's photo library.
